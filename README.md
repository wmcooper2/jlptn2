# Start Here
- Begin by making a simple flashcard setup for daily vocab, grammar and sentence typing practice.
- Then use that for inputting new data manually?
- Save all data to CSV files for now.


# Create Base App
[React Docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)
```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```





# Data
- [Radicals](https://github.com/kanjialive/kanji-data-media.git)
- [Kanji](https://github.com/davidluzgouveia/kanji-data.git)


# Goal
Make a simple flashcard app for testing myself on N2 level vocab.

## Future Goals (maybe)
- Add sentences to practice typing with, because the existing apps are annoying with ads and other crap.
- Make a "shiritori" wordle/scrabble like game for vocab building
